# Architecture

Catenary is a multiplexing bridge between MCP and LSP. AI agents talk
to Catenary through MCP tools; Catenary translates those into LSP
requests to one or more language servers, collects results, and returns
them through MCP.

## Three protocols

Every external interaction crosses one of three protocol boundaries:

- **MCP** — agent ↔ Catenary. The agent calls tools (`grep`, `glob`,
  `start_editing`, `done_editing`) and receives structured results.
- **LSP** — Catenary ↔ language servers. Catenary spawns and manages
  language server processes, sending requests and receiving
  notifications over JSON-RPC stdio.
- **Hooks** — host CLI ↔ Catenary. The host CLI (Claude Code, Gemini
  CLI) fires hooks at lifecycle boundaries (pre-tool, post-tool,
  pre-agent, post-agent, session start). Hook processes connect to the
  running session's IPC socket and exchange JSON messages.

## Multiplexing

A single Catenary session can manage multiple language servers across
multiple workspace roots. Files route to the right server(s) based on
language detection, configuration, and server capabilities. A Rust
file goes to rust-analyzer; a TypeScript file goes to
typescript-language-server. If a language has multiple configured
servers, Catenary dispatches to all of them and merges results.

## Hexagonal structure

Catenary follows a port/adapter pattern. Three boundary components own
all protocol logging:

- **`McpServer`** — MCP protocol adapter. Reads JSON-RPC from stdin,
  dispatches tool calls, writes responses to stdout.
- **`LspClient`** — LSP protocol adapter. One instance per language
  server process. Manages the JSON-RPC connection, document state, and
  capability negotiation.
- **`HookServer`** — Hook protocol adapter. Listens on an IPC socket,
  dispatches hook requests, returns responses.

**`LoggingServer`** is the telemetry port. It is a `tracing` Layer
that dispatches events to two sinks: a notification queue (for
user-facing `systemMessage` delivery) and a message database (for
monitor visibility, debugging, and TUI broadcast). Every protocol
message flows through it.

Tool servers (`GrepServer`, `GlobServer`, `DiagnosticsServer`) are the
transformation layer. They receive application-level parameters, do
work using `LspClient`, and return results. They do not log protocol
messages — that is the boundary components' job. A tool server is a
black box: the protocol messages that went in and came out are linked
by `parent_id` at the database level.

## Shared infrastructure

- **`Toolbox`** — application container. Owns tool servers, the client
  manager, filesystem manager, editing state, path validation, logging,
  and the tree-sitter index. Protocol boundaries hold `Arc<Toolbox>`.
- **`FilesystemManager`** — file classification and root resolution.
  Single authority for language detection, shebang parsing, and
  workspace root membership. Also implements the snapshot-and-diff
  model for `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` notifications.
- **`LspClientManager`** — LSP server lifecycle. Spawns, caches, and
  shuts down `LspClient` instances. Manages instance keying (language,
  server name, scope), multi-server routing, document lifecycle, and
  workspace folder synchronization.
- **SQLite database** — all session state (sessions, protocol
  messages, trace events, workspace roots, language servers) is stored
  in `~/.local/state/catenary/catenary.db` with WAL mode.
