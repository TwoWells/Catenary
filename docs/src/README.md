Catenary gives AI coding agents LSP-powered code intelligence. It
manages a pool of language servers and exposes them through CLI commands
and hooks — search, diagnostics, and navigation without shell-based text
scanning.

Two CLI search commands — `catenary grep` and `catenary glob` — plus a
tracked editing surface: edits flow through the host's Edit/Write tools
(or native `sed -i` for sweeps, whose writes the hook tracks too), and
`catenary diagnostics` reports the errors and warnings for every file
touched. Editing is tracked
automatically — the first edit starts it, there is no start step. The
agent never needs to know which language server handles which file.
