# Catenary

Catenary is an MCP server that gives AI coding agents LSP-powered code
intelligence. It multiplexes one or more language servers behind a single
MCP interface, providing search, diagnostics, and navigation without
shell-based text scanning.

Two MCP tools (`grep` and `glob`) plus post-edit diagnostics via hooks.
The agent never needs to know which language server handles which file.
