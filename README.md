## Status: archived (October 2026)

I'm retiring Catenary. The idea worked. The implementation is the part
that stopped making sense to maintain.

The idea was that you get better behavior out of a coding agent by
construction than by instruction: take the generic tools off the menu,
put one code-intelligent surface in front of the agent, and enforce it
with a hook. The agent follows the workflow when there's no other path.
That held up for me in daily use across every project I run, and the
post-mortems on this year's agent incidents, the PocketOS database
deletion in April and the Hugging Face breach in July, came to the same
conclusion: the controls have to live where the agent can't reach them.

It didn't start out that way. Catenary began as language-server access
over MCP: hover, definitions, references and diagnostics as tools an
agent could call. Agents didn't reach for them on their own. So I did
two things. I shrank the surface: instead of a dozen LSP tools, two
commands the agent already had habits for, a grep and an ls, enriched
with what the language server knows. And I added deny lists in the
clients to steer agents toward them. Then I moved the deny list into
Catenary itself, and that's where the hook came from. Once Catenary
owned the list it could do fine-grained allowlists, denying some forms
of a command while allowing others, which in turn needed a proper bash
parser.

The lists kept growing, because the hook wasn't only a gatekeeper.
Catenary tracked which files an agent had touched so it could insist on
a diagnostics check afterward. That meant inferring intent from
commands, telling a perl one-liner that edits a file apart from one that
runs arbitrary code. It meant keeping state per agent, which meant
giving each agent an identity and carrying it through the hooks over
IPC. Each layer made sense when I added it. Taken together it's a lot of
code, and somewhere in there I started seeing code as a liability to be
maintained rather than an asset.

Catenary was built with Catenary. Every session that wrote this code ran
through it, from the first hook on, and I didn't write a line of it by
hand. What I did instead was hold the line on the engineering: clippy on
pedantic, mutation testing, every regression pinned with a test, and
every breakage I hit while dogfooding enshrined in one. And I read the
plans instead of the code. The planning repo ended up the same size as
the codebase, and since the code was rewritten so often, the plans and
the tests were the real source. Git on the code was snapshots.

The maintenance cost came from both sides of the hook. The agent clients
Catenary sits in front of move fast. Hook systems, permission models and
tool surfaces change month to month, and a third-party layer between an
agent and its host has to chase every one of those releases. The
original plan had an answer for that, a client of my own, so I'd control
both ends. That isn't possible with the subscription plans most
individuals use, and individuals are who Catenary was for. On the other
side, every language server needed its own exceptions, and Catenary
ended up with a blessed list of servers, each with its own known
behaviors to work around. So Catenary is a plugin trying to be a client,
and I don't see the effort to keep it there as worth my time.

Meanwhile the clients started shipping the important pieces themselves:
permission allowlists and language-server integration. Once the platform
does what your tool was for, the right move is to let it.

I learned a lot from this one. An agent running as you treats
restrictions as obstacles, not guardrails. It will find the path you
didn't close. It's also easy to over-restrict, and every rule you add
makes the agent a little less useful. If you actually need the agent
kept out of something, the answer is a real sandbox, not a smarter deny
list. A layer that sits in front of every tool call is on the critical
path of every session: when Catenary broke, it failed shut and blocked
work. And the limit turned out to be review, not code. Dispatching whole
features means one person reviewing a team's output, and the stronger
the model, the more arrives finished and built upon before anyone has
looked at it. Process organizes that reading. Nothing shrinks it.

What's still going: [Lattice](https://github.com/TwoWells/Lattice), the
markdown linter that grew out of this work, is maintained. And the way
of working Catenary came from, enforce by construction, instrument
everything, retire on evidence, is how I run my other projects. The code
stays up as a reference: a daemon that multiplexes many agents onto a
shared pool of language servers, a PreToolUse allowlist whose denials
point at the sanctioned alternative, resolve-or-deny writes, and an
edit-debt gate for diagnostics. The last release, the Homebrew formula
and the AUR packages are left as they were. None of it is maintained.

Catenary hands an AI coding agent a small, opinionated set of
code-intelligent commands — and a hook that keeps it on them. Reach for
`grep` and you're redirected to `catenary grep`; reach for `ls` or `find`
and you get `catenary glob`. Every command the agent can run is backed by a
language server, so it navigates code by meaning instead of brute-forcing
text. The generic path isn't blocked for safety — it's off the menu, so
the code-intelligent one is the only path left.

## Why Catenary

Exposing language-server tools to an agent isn't novel anymore — most
coding CLIs do it, and Catenary did it early. But *having* a tool and
*using* it are different things. Give an agent `grep`, `find`, raw file
reads, **and** LSP navigation, and it reaches for whatever's nearest —
usually brute-force text scanning that burns context and misses structure.

Catenary takes the choice away. It exposes one curated, code-intelligent
surface and enforces it:

- A `PreToolUse` hook runs an **allowlist** over every shell command the
  agent issues.
- Denied commands aren't dead ends — each denial **names the
  code-intelligent command to run instead** (`grep` → `catenary grep`,
  `ls`/`find` → `catenary glob`).
- Edits flow through the host's tracked Edit/Write tools, so LSP
  diagnostics come back automatically when the agent runs `catenary
  diagnostics`.

The result is a workflow the agent follows by construction, not by
prompt-engineering.

**This is enforcement of a workflow, not a security sandbox.** The hook is
a cooperative contract — a Makefile can still run anything, and Catenary
doesn't isolate the filesystem or environment. Its job is narrower and
more useful: keep the agent's reads on code-intelligent search and its
writes on a tracked path, so navigation is structural and diagnostics are
free.

### Less context, more signal

A grep-and-read loop pulls whole files into the agent's context window and
re-processes them every turn. `catenary grep` answers with the symbol, its
signature, and where it's used — tens of tokens instead of thousands.
Diagnostics arrive through `catenary diagnostics` stdout, so the agent
never re-reads a file just to check whether its edit compiled.

## The surface

**Search** — always available, no setup beyond installation:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `catenary grep <pattern>` | Symbol, reference, and text search — LSP-enriched within tracked roots |
| `catenary glob <path>` | File outlines, directory listings, glob matches |

**The edit → diagnostics loop** — run in the host's shell tool:

```bash
# Edit files with the host's native Edit/Write tools. Editing starts
# automatically on the first change to a server-covered file — there is
# no start step.
catenary diagnostics      # print LSP diagnostics for every file you
                          # touched, then clear the set
```

`catenary diagnostics` is the *end* of an edit batch: it opens the
modified files on their servers, waits for each to settle, and prints the
errors and warnings — like a linter, it's silent on success. For sweeps
too broad for per-file edits, reach for native `sed -i` — the hook
resolves its write-set and folds the changed files into the same
diagnostics batch.

**Workspace roots** — manage which directories are indexed:

```bash
catenary roots add <path>   # index a directory
catenary roots rm <path>
catenary roots ls
```

## How it fits together

One daemon per host manages a shared pool of language servers. Multiple
agents connect over a Unix socket and share those servers — a single
`rust-analyzer` serves every session on the same project. Catenary reaches
the agent through four decoupled surfaces; none depends on the others.

```
agents ──▶  Catenary daemon  ──▶  shared LSP server pool
                                  rust-analyzer · pyright · gopls · …

reached through four decoupled surfaces:

  CLI     grep · glob · diagnostics         — via the host's shell tool
  Hooks   allowlist enforcement             — one PreToolUse hook
  MCP     heartbeat + workspace roots       — no query tools
  TUI     live observability                — protocol & trace traffic
```

- **CLI** — the code-intelligent commands above, invoked through the
  host's shell tool. Stateless: each command connects to the daemon,
  delegates to the right language servers, and prints to stdout.
- **Hooks** — the `PreToolUse` allowlist that enforces the workflow and
  tracks edited files for the diagnostics batch.
- **MCP** — a heartbeat only: the protocol handshake, the workspace-roots
  channel, and user-facing notifications. It advertises **no** query tools.
- **TUI** — real-time observability across every session and language
  server.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**Homebrew (macOS and Linux):**

```bash
brew install twowells/tap/catenary
```

> Switching from a `cargo install` (the previously recommended path)?
> Run `cargo uninstall catenary-cli` first — or `cargo uninstall
> catenary-mcp` if you installed before 2.1.0, when the crate carried
> that name. `~/.cargo/bin` usually precedes brew's bin dir on `PATH`,
> so the stale binary keeps answering otherwise.

**Prebuilt binary (Linux x86_64 / macOS arm64):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TwoWells/Catenary/main/install.sh | sh
```

**From source (any platform with a Rust toolchain):**

```bash
cargo install catenary-cli
```

The `catenary` binary must be on your `PATH` before configuring any
client. Plugins and extensions provide hooks and the MCP declaration but
**do not include the binary** — this step is required.

> **Upgrading from 1.x?** Every breaking change in 2.0 is to user
> configuration — read the
> [migration guide](https://twowells.github.io/Catenary/stable/migrating-to-2.0.html)
> before upgrading, and run `catenary doctor` after: it flags each stale
> config form with the exact rename.

### 2. Configure language servers

Add your language servers to `~/.config/catenary/config.toml`:

```toml
# The [lsp.server.*] section key IS the binary Catenary spawns; bind a
# language to it under [lsp.language.*]. Add `path = "/abs/path"` only to
# relocate a binary that is not on PATH.
[lsp.server.rust-analyzer]

[lsp.server.pyright-langserver]
args = ["--stdio"]

[lsp.language.rust]
servers = ["rust-analyzer"]

[lsp.language.python]
servers = ["pyright-langserver"]
```

Catenary can install the servers itself. Opt in with:

```toml
[servers]
auto_install = true
```

Any configured server that has passed Catenary's conformance gate is then
installed at its vetted, pinned version into a Catenary-owned directory —
in the background, at session start, with no per-server install step.
Servers already on `PATH` are left alone. The opt-in is honored from your
user config only; a project `.catenary.toml` can never switch it on.
(`catenary install` is unrelated: it installs host plugins, not language
servers.)

### 3. Connect your agent

**Claude Code**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add TwoWells/Catenary
claude plugin install catenary@catenary
```

**Antigravity CLI** — copy `plugins/catenary-antigravity/` to
`.agents/plugins/catenary/` in your workspace.

### 4. Verify

```bash
catenary doctor
```

`doctor` reports each configured server's status (`ready`, `command not
found`, `spawn failed`, `initialize failed`) and whether the host's hooks
are installed and current. Managed installs count as installed, and a
system-installed server whose version drifts from the vetted pin draws an
advisory finding naming both versions. Pass a server name (`catenary
doctor rust-analyzer`) for verbose single-server diagnostics.

## Observability

Run `catenary` in a terminal to launch the TUI dashboard — a live view of
every session, every language server, and the protocol traffic between
them. Catenary keeps a `state.json` snapshot of live state and streams
full protocol and trace detail to a sharded JSONL telemetry firehose; the
TUI reads the snapshot, and `catenary query` reads the firehose. (There is
no SQLite database — a legacy one is drained on startup.)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `catenary` | Launch the TUI dashboard |
| `catenary query` | Query the telemetry firehose (by session, server, tool, time, …) |
| `catenary doctor` | Verify language servers and hook installation |
| `catenary version` | Show the CLI and running-daemon versions |
| `catenary stop` | Stop the running daemon |
